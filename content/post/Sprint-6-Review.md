# <center>Sprint 6 Review - Explosion Update!</center>

***

### <span style="color:#012033"> <center>3-Shot Explosion</center> </span>

Throughout our many versions of Pathos, there was one thing that everyone
continued to enjoy in our game. Explosions. In the previous few builds, we
didn't have any boom-booms and it just seemed to leave a void in our hearts.
Not any longer! In this sprint we added a much anticipated feature that we have
had planned for a while now. The triple shot explosion. The idea is that when
the player shoots a guard up with too many drugs, their body will just combust.
Morbid but fun.

This only works when the player shoots 3 of the same kind of drug into a guard
in a row. If for example, the player shoots two anger darts into a guard, and
then a fear dart, the explosion counter will get reset because the fear dart
wasn't anger. When a guard explodes, it will kill guards around him and will
break any breakables. Although we did add this feature as a fun factor, there
is definitely some utility to it as well.

### <span style="color:#012033"> <center>Explosive Drums</center> </span>

Not only do the guards explode, but now there are explosive drums! An explosive
drum can be triggered by an angry guard smacking it. There are 5 types of
barrels. 1 for each emotion type, and one that just explodes and kills. If an
emotion type barrel explodes, it makes every guard in the area around the barrel
change to the emotion type, as if they all got shot by an emotion dart. This
mechanic opens up a lot of doors in terms of level design, and adds a lot of
fun chaos.

### <span style="color:#012033"> <center>Vision Cone Visual Update</center> </span>

Explosions aren't the only thing we have been working on this sprint. The new
updates to the vision cone make everything look a lot smoother. The transitions
of the vision cones (like when they change color or size) are now lerped. This
means that rather than an immediate color or size change, it will make a smooth
transition into it. Just that small bit of polish made the game look a lot
better.

### <span style="color:#012033"> <center>Big Character Model Progress</center> </span>

The real character model for the guards is SO close to being put into the game.
The rigging for it is all complete. Here is an example of a walking animation:
