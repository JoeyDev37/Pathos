      <description>Sprint 6 Review - Explosion Update! 3-Shot Explosion  Throughout our many versions of Pathos, there was one thing that everyone continued to enjoy in our game. Explosions. In the previous few builds, we didn&amp;rsquo;t have any boom-booms and it just seemed to leave a void in our hearts. Not any longer! In this sprint we added a much anticipated feature that we have had planned for a while now.</description>

      <description>Sprint 5 Review - Big Gameplay Update! Enemy Behavior Revamp  In previous versions of Pathos, we pushed to give the player much more precise control over the behaviors of enemies. After several iterations of testing the new mechanics, we realized that passing control of the enemies&amp;rsquo; actions over to the user interrupted the gameplay and lead to a somewhat choppy experience.
Our solution was to remove the direct control completely.</description>
